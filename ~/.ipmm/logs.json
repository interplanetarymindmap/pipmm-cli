It covers all three phases of his career: his early work concerning cognitive biases, his work on prospect theory, and his later work on happiness. The integrity of many of the priming studies cited in the book have been called into question in the midst of the psychological replication crisis, although the results of Kahneman's own studies have replicated.The main thesis is that of a dichotomy between two modes of thought: [[ref-system-1-1620203198]] is fast, instinctive and emotional; [[ref-system-2-1620203553]] is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates rational and non-rational motivations/triggers associated with each type of thinking process, and how they complement each other, starting with [[daniel-kahneman-1620203355]]'s own research on loss aversion. From framing choices to people's tendency to replace a difficult question with one which is easy to answer, the book summarizes several decades of research to suggest that people have too much confidence in human judgement.\nprop-reference-1612697985:\n prop-ref-type-1612700534: typebook1612381811\n prop-uri-1612700471: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow\n

Can we derive anything interesting from it?\n`t1 (t2 x) y\n\n## Named parameters\n\nIt is tempting to make a notation system that allows for `named parameters` but the only advantage I see would be to make it human-readable-friendly.\nGiven that the [[abstraction-reference-1612699252]] are long alphanumeric numbers, being human-friendly is not something to optimize for, specially since it's assumed that the writting will be assisted by the [[ipfoam-runtime-1614833118]]\nThe [[s-expr-1626248935]] are a much more elgant structure.\n\n# Formating\n\n## Format\n\n> Likely the current decision wont be the right one. It needs to bee just good enough for now\n\nThe format should be able to be expressed sandalone but also embeded in text.\n\nA [[json-1626280231]] array structure seems a natural way to express a [[transclusion-expression-1613026811]].\n\nPros\n- It is [[ipld-1612088855]] compatible\n- No need for custom parsers\n- It can be extended if I need to add some sort of data that I'm currently not conceving.\n- Can use [[json-1626280231]] objects as arguments. I believe an [[s-expr-1626248935]] expression we will need additional assumptions in order to write key-value pairs.\n- The `{`,`}`,`[`,`]` characters used to tokenize [[json-1626280231]] are uncommon in [[natural-language-1613596219]] which is where they could be conflicting if we need to embed them in a text.\nCons\n- There will be \"unnecessary\" `\"` characters sorounding the  [[abstraction-reference-1612699252]]\n- There will be \"unnecessary\" `,` to separate the array elements\n  \nIn a simple [[transclusion-1625221775]] (no [[transform-1613076164]]s), compared to an [[s-expr-1626248935]], a [[json-1626280231]] array will have only the commas as and square brackets as extra, and the square brackets will be needed anyway as tokens to tokenize the [[interplanetary-text-1612698201]]\n\nQ: Are thre any alternatives to [[json-1626280231]]? Would a new format make sense?\nA: Likley, no need to prematurely optimize it now\n  \n## Composition\n\nAssuming we use [[json-1626280231]] arrays to represent a [[transclusion-1625221775]] the following are possible compositions:\n`a`: Argument: An [[abstraction-reference-1612699252]] or a valid [[json-1626280231]] value (string, number,object ,array, boolean, null)\n`t`: Transform: An [[abstraction-reference-1612699252]]\n\n### No [[transform-1613076164]]\n\nNo [[transform-1613076164]] is applied\nIs the only occasion where the first argument doesn't make a reference to a [[transform-1613076164]]\nE: `[a]`\n\n### Simple\n\nFirst element is a [[transform-1613076164]] the following are arguments\nE: `[t,a,a]`\n\n### Nested\n\nE: `[t, a, [t,a]]`\n\n### Multiple nesting\n\nE: `[t, a,[t,[t,a,[t,a],[t,a]]]`\n\n### With primitive types\n\nE: `[t,1,4]` // `t` being a sum for exmple\n\n### With objects\n\nE: `[t,{\"key1\":value1,\"key2\":{\"key21\":true}}]`\n\n### [[transform-1613076164]] is outcome of another [[transform-1613076164]]\n\n- If the outcome of the inner [[transform-1613076164]] fits the requirements to be considered a [[transform-1613076164]] should be evaulated and executed as such.\n  E: `[[t,a],a]`\n\n## Runtime and evaluations\n\n- Steps:The [[transclusion-1625221775]] will be evaluated from the leaves\n- Single element is assumed to not have [[transform-1613076164]].\n- A mal formatted [[json-1626280231]] [[transclusion-expression-1613026811]] inside [[interplanetary-text-1612698201]] will be ignored and presented as simple text. This also allows the use of the token characters to be used for [[natural-language-1613596219]] writting\n- The [[transform-1613076164]] needs to define its arity. Could be infinite. But needs to be known.\n- The [[transform-1613076164]] needs to express if a value is optional\n- Empty values are represented by `null`, In case [[transclusion-1625221775]] alows optional arguments.

This translates to the [[abstraction-reference-1612699252]] being a [[cid-1612383388]] representation\n\n## Mutable\n\nThe [[abstraction-reference-1612699252]] can be [[content-addressed-1625478907]] but is not required.\nThis is very relevant when we want to reference the [[abstraction-intent-1625480615]] instead of its [[content-1625149127]].\nIn this case we should use [[ipfoam-1612121966]] specfic protocol :\nhttps://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/protocols/\n\n`ipmm/mindId/noteId/propertyId/fragment`\nE: I want to reference someone's current [[view-1612896731]] of a subject\n\nQ: What [[ipfoam-property-1613029553]], should be used for the [[transclusion-expression-1613026811]]?\nA: It needs to be explicitely defined, the editor can facilitate the task and use a default such as [[prop-title-1612697362]]\n\n<[[intent-identifier-1612383211]]> / <[[ipfoam-property-1613029553]]UID>\n\n## Progressive\n\nUsing `Strictly inmutable` or `Mutable` types assumes that only a specific set of predefined protocols will be used. And those can be fit in one or the other category. Alternatively we could allow each [[interplanetary-text-1612698201]] \"document\" to define which protocls it allows.\n\n# [[transclusion-dynamics-1625732689]]\n\n# User interface\n\n# Non-human readable friendly format\n\n[[Markdown-1626109621]] is loved because it balances very well the simplicity of the format with its expressivity. Part of the simplicity is being able to write seeing the source-code, therefore having much more control over it.\nWhile this is desirable, I don't believe is possible. Expressing a [[transclusion-expression-1613026811]] is very verbose, mostly because is composed of [[abstraction-reference-1612699252]]s which are mostly long chains of non-human readable strings.\n\n[[transclusion-1625221775]] within the [[markdown-1626109621]]-notes world have inherited the image link syntax:\n\n`md ![Human readable name](URI_of_the_image) `\nThis may be used in my [[foam-bubble-1612213783]] transition towards [[ipfoam-1612121966]]\n\n## Human friendly [[intent-identifier-1612383211]]s\n\nWhile the format may not be human-readable-friendly, the ui still needs to allow the user to select and define [[abstraction-reference-1612699252]].
