often in collaboration with Amos Tversky. It covers all three phases of his career: his early work concerning cognitive biases, his work on prospect theory, and his later work on happiness. The integrity of many of the priming studies cited in the book have been called into question in the midst of the psychological replication crisis, although the results of Kahneman's own studies have replicated.The main thesis is that of a dichotomy between two modes of thought: [[ref-system-1-1620203198]] is fast, instinctive and emotional; [[ref-system-2-1620203553]] is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates rational and non-rational motivations/triggers associated with each type of thinking process, and how they complement each other, starting with [[daniel-kahneman-1620203355]]'s own research on loss aversion. From framing choices to people's tendency to replace a difficult question with one which is easy to answer, the book summarizes several decades of research to suggest that people have too much
